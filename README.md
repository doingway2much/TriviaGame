# TriviaGame
This is a trivia game that I created for week 5 of my Georgia Tech Coding boot camp

THis game has a "Price is Right" theme.

The rules are:

You have 15 seconds to guess the right anwser
If you get a right anwser you will see an image related to the anwser
If you get the wrong anwser you will see a diffrent image. 
IF you don't anwser a question in the given time the game will move onto the next question
